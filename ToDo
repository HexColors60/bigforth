This file describes all the things left to do on bigFORTH/MINOS. The list
is not complete, so you should add topics you miss or refine existing
topics. If you are working on a topic, add your name to the right of
the topic. If you have completed the work, remove the topic.

This an emacs outline. Use '*' to create topics.
