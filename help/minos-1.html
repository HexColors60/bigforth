<H1><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</H1>

<H2>What's MINOS?</H2>

<P>MINOS is the answer to the question ``Is there something like
Visual BASIC (Microsoft) or Delphi (Inprise) in Forth?'' - and the
answer is ``yes''.</P>

<P>Basically, these GUI RADs contain two components: a library with a
wide variety of elements for a graphical user interface; e.g. windows,
buttons, edit-controls, drawing areas, etc.; and an editor to combine
the elements with the mouse by drag&amp;drop or click&amp;point
actions. Missing code then is inserted to add actions when buttons are
pressed.</P>

<P>Typical applications are often related to data base
access. Therefore, many of these systems already contain a data base
engine or at least a standardized interface to a data base, such as
ODBC.</P>

<P>Another aspect are complex components. With some of these toolkits,
you can create a web browser with some mouse clicks and a few
keystrokes. However, these components hide their details, a shrink
wrapped web browser application is not necessarily worse.</P>

<P>The interactivity of these tools usually is not very high. You
create your form, write your actions as code and compile it more
(Delphi) or less (Visual Age for C++) fast. Trying it usually isn't
possible before the compiler run.</P>


<H2>Why Visual?</H2>

<P>It isn't really necessary to brush graphical user interfaces
together, as it isn't to edit texts WYSIWYG. Many typesetting
functions are more semantically than visual, e.g. a text is a headline
or emphasized instead of written in bold 18 point Garamond or 11 point
Roman italics. All this is true for user interfaces, to some extend
much more. It's not the programmer that decides which font and size to
use for the UI - that's up to the user. As is color of buttons and
texts.</P>

<P>Also to layout individual widgets, more abstraction than defining
position, width and height makes sense. Typically buttons are arranged
horizontally or vertically, perhaps with a bit distance between
them. The size of buttons must follow the containing strings, and
should conform to aesthetics (e.g. each button in a row has the same
width).</P>

<P>Such an abstract model, related to TeX's boxes&amp;glues, programs
quite good even without a visual editor. The programmer isn't
responsible for ``typesetting'' the buttons and boxes. This approach
is quite usual in Unix. Motif and Tcl/Tk use neighborhood relations,
Interviews uses boxes&amp;glues. I decided for boxes&amp;glues, since it's a
fast and intuitive solution, although it needs more objects to get the
same result.</P>

<P>These concepts contradict somehow with a graphical editing process,
since the editors I know don't provide abstract concepts (``place left
of an object'' or ``place in a row''), but positions.</P>


<H2>Visual Forth?</H2>

<P>One point makes me think: the packets that allow real visual form
programming have many years of programming invested in. Microsoft,
Borland, and IBM may hire hundreds of programmers just for one such
project. This man-power isn't available for any Forth project. But
stop:</P>

<OL>
<LI> Forth claims that good programmers can work much more
efficient with Forth

<LI> A team of 300 (wo)men blocks itself. If the boss partitions the
work, the programmers need to document functions, and to read
documents from other programmer related to other functions and must
understand them, or ask questions to figure things out. Everybody
knows that documenting takes much longer than writing the code, and
explaining is even worse. Thus at a certain project complexity level,
no time is left for the programming task; all time is used to specify
planned functions and read the specification from other
programmers. Or the programmers just chat before the door holes of the
much too small and noisy cubicles.

<LI> A good programmer reportedly works 20 times as fast as a bad,
even though he can't type in more key strokes per time. The resulting
program is either up to 20 times shorter or has 20 times less bugs (or
both) - with more functionality at the same time. Teamwork however
prevents good programmers from work, since they are frustrated by bad
programmers surrounding them, from their inability to produce required
information in time; and the bad programmers are frustrated by the
good ones, which makes them even worse.

<LI> Therefore, even in large projects, the real work is (or should
be) done by a small ``core team''. Then the Dilbert rule applies: what
can be done with two people, can be done with one at half of the
costs.

</OL>

Furthermore, bigFORTH-DOS already contains a ``Text-GUI'', without
graphical editor, but with an abstract boxes&amp;glue concept, which, as
claimed above, hinders the use of such an editor.</P>

<P>Finally I wanted to get rid of DOS, and port bigFORTH to a real
operating system (Linux). In contrast to Windows and OS/2, user
interface and screen access are separated there. Drawing on the screen
uses the X Window System (short X), the actual user interface is
implemented in a library. This is the reason, why there is no common
interface, but a lot of different libraries, such as Athena Widgets,
Motif, Tcl/Tk, xforms, Qt, gtk, and others. The ``look and feel'' from
Motif-like buttons is quite common, even Windows and MacOS resemble
it.</P>

<P>All these libraries have disadvantages. The Athena Widgets are
hopelessly outdated.  Motif is commercial, even if a free clone
(Lesstif) is in creation. It's slow and a memory hog. Tcl/Tk consumes
less memory, but it's <EM>even</EM> slower.  How do you explain your
users that drawing a window takes seconds, while Quake renders
animated 3D-graphic on the same machine? Qt is fast, but it's written
in C++ and doesn't have a foreign language interface now. gtk, the
GIMP toolkit, has more foreign language interfaces, and it's free, but
it wasn't available until recently.</P>

<P>Therefore I decided to port the widget classes from bigFORTH-DOS
to X, and write an editor for it. Such classes written in Forth
naturally fit in an development environment and are - from the Forth
point of view - easier to maintain.  There are not such many widget
libraries in C, because it's a task written in an afternoon, but
because the available didn't fit the requests, and a modification
looked desperate.</P>


<H2>The Name - Why MINOS?</H2>

<P>``Visual XXX'' is an all day's name, and it's too much of a
microsoftism for me. ``Forth'' is a no-word, especially since the
future market consists of one billion Chinese, and for them four is a
number of unluck (because ``se'' (four) sounds much like ``se''
(death)). However, even Borland doesn't call their system ``Visual
TurboPascal'', but ``Delphi''.</P>

<P>Greek is good, anyway, since this library relates to the
boxes&amp;glues model of TeX, which is pronounced Greek, too. Compared
with Motif, the library is quite copact (MINimal), and since it's
mainly for Linux, the phonetic distance is small... I pronounce it
Greek: ``meenoz''.</P>


<H2>Port to Windows</H2>

<P>I ported MINOS to Windows 95/NT, on the demand of some potential
users. It doesn't run near as stable as under Linux/X, since there are
a hideous number of subtle bugs in Windows, and I don't have the time
to work around all of them. Drawing polygons doesn't work as well as
on X, and all the bugs that are in the memory drawing device can drive
me nuts. The Windows port of MINOS looks more like the ``modern
Forth'' Claus Vogt portrayed in <A
HREF="news:de.comp.lang.forth">de.comp.lang.forth</A>: it shows random
general protection faults. Well, just like any other Windows
program.</P>
