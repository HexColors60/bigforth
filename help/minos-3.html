<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 3D Turtle Graphics - ``Dragon Graphics''</A></H2>

<P>To support OpenGL drawing and make it much easier than plain
OpenGL, there is a 3D turtle graphics, also called ``dragon
graphics''. The basic principle of turtle graphics is the ``turtle'',
a directed point in the coordinate space that can move around and
leaves a trail on its way.</P>

<P>For 2D turtle graphics, there are not much settings to choose. You
can set the color and the width of the line you stroke, or choose to
fill your path, but that's it. 3D objects have much more aspects than
simple lines or flat surfaces. Therefore, a 3D turtle graphics demands
other features to define the trail it leaves.</P>

<P>First, the turtle flies through space, and is therefore called
``dragon''. This increases the degree of freedom - a 2D turtle can
only turn left or right, a 3D dragon can turn left, right, up, and
down. Additionally, it can roll to the left or right.</P>

<P>Then you have to define the vertex points of your trail yourself. You
can define points around the current position of the dragon, which are
connected to points around the previous stop of the dragon. These
rounds around the dragon are knit together, forming the ``trail'' of
the dragon. You can add or drop vertex points, but if you drop point,
make sure that they are at least on a straight line (or better all on
the same location).</P>

<P>There are several groups of operation, let's start with the
navigation of the dragon. The angles used are radians by default.
<UL>
<LI><B>left</B> ( f -- ) turns the dragon's head left
<LI><B>right</B> ( f -- ) turns the dragon's head right
<LI><B>up</B> ( f -- ) turns the dragon's head up
<LI><B>down</B> ( f -- ) turns the dragon's head down
<LI><B>roll-left</B> ( f -- ) rolls the dragon's head left
<LI><B>roll-right</B> ( f -- ) rolls the dragon's head right
<LI><B>x-left</B> ( f -- ) rotate the dragon left around the x axis
<LI><B>x-right</B> ( f -- ) rotate the dragon right around the x axis
<LI><B>y-left</B> ( f -- ) rotate the dragon left around the y axis
<LI><B>y-right</B> ( f -- ) rotate the dragon right around the y axis
<LI><B>z-left</B> ( f -- ) rotate the dragon left around the z axis
<LI><B>z-right</B> ( f -- ) rotate the dragon right around the z axis
<LI><B>forward</B> ( f -- ) move the dragon in z direction
<LI><B>forward-xyz</B> ( fx fy fz -- ) move the dragon
<LI><B>degrees</B> ( f -- ) steps per circle. Common cases: 2pi for
radians, 360 for deg, 64 for asian degrees, or whatever you find
suits your application best.
<LI><B>scale</B> ( f -- ) scales the dragon's step width by the factor f
<LI><B>scale-xyz</B> ( fx fy fz -- ) scale the dragon's step width in
x, y, and z direction
<LI><B>flip-clock</B> ( -- ) change default coordinate from left hand
to right or the other way round. Use that after scale-xyz with an odd
number of negative scale factors.
</UL></P>

<P>There are some functions to save and restore the turtle's state,
and to use the turtle matrix stack for matrix multiplications, so that
you can create arbitrary synthetic transformations with one step.
<UL>
<LI><B>&gt;matrix</B> ( -- ) push turtle matrix on the matrix stack
<LI><B>matrix&gt;</B> ( -- ) pop turtle matrix from the matrix stack
<LI><B>matrix@</B> ( -- ) copy turtle matrix from the stack
<LI><B>1matrix</B> ( -- ) initialize turtle state with the identity matrix
<LI><B>matrix*</B> ( -- ) multiply current transformation matrix with
the one on the top of the matrix stack (and pop that one)
<LI><B>clone</B> ( -- o ) create a clone of the turtle
<LI><B>&gt;turtle</B> ( -- ) clone the turtle and use it as current object
<LI><B>turtle&gt;</B> ( -- ) destroy current turtle and pop previos
incarnation
</UL></P>

<P>Then there are the operations to create pathes. A path is
partitioned in ``rounds'', where each point in one round is connected
to the corresponding point in the previous round. Rounds can add
points or drop points from the previous round (dropped points are not
connected, and therefore should be at least in a line with those
points that are connected). The first round in a path has to be
defined immediately after open-path, the other rounds must be enclosed
in open-round and close-round.
<UL>
<LI><B>open-path</B> ( n -- ) opens a path with n points in the first
round
<LI><B>close-path</B> ( -- ) closes a path and performs the final
rendering action
<LI><B>next-round</B> ( -- ) closes a round and opens the next one
<LI><B>open-round</B> ( n -- ) opens a round with n points (obsolete)
<LI><B>close-round</B> ( -- ) closes a round (by copying the first
point as last point) and performs the per-round rendering action (obsolete)
<LI><B>finish-round</B> ( -- ) performs the per-round rendering
action without closing the round first (this is for open objects) (obsolete)
<LI><B>add-xyz</B> ( fx fy fz -- ) adds the point at the
x,y,z-coordinates relative to the turtle. x is up from the turtle, y
right, z before. The point is connected to the same point of the
previous round as the point before.
<LI><B>set-xyz</B> ( fx fy fz -- ) sets a point with
x,y,z-coordinates. The point is connected to the next point of the
previous round as the point before.
<LI><B>drop-point</B> ( -- ) skips one point, set-xyz is equal to
add-xyz drop-point
<LI><B>set-rpz</B> ( fr fphi fz -- ) set with cylinder coordinates
<LI><B>set-xy</B> ( fx fy -- ) set-xyz with z=0
<LI><B>set-rp</B> ( fr fphi -- ) set with cylinder coordinates, z=0
<LI><B>set-r</B> ( fr -- ) set with cylinder coordinates, z=0,
phi=current_phi, current_phi+=dphi
<LI><B>set</B> ( -- ) set at current dragon location
<LI><B>add-rpz</B> ( fr fphi fz -- ) add with cylinder coordinates
<LI><B>add-xy</B> ( fx fy -- ) add-xyz with z=0
<LI><B>add-rp</B> ( fr fphi -- ) add with cylinder coordinates, z=0
<LI><B>add-r</B> ( fr -- ) add with cylinder coordinates, z=0,
phi=current_phi, current_phi+=dphi
<LI><B>add</B> ( -- ) add at current dragon location
<LI><B>set-dphi</B> ( fdphi -- ) sets dphi
</UL></P>

<P>The turtle graphics supports several drawing modes: points,
wire-frame, solid, and textured.

<LI><B>points</B> ( -- ) draw only vertex points
<LI><B>lines</B> ( -- ) draw a wire frame
<LI><B>triangles</B> ( -- ) draw solid triangles

<LI><B>zp-texture</B> ( -- ) texture mapping based on z and the point

<LI><B>load-texture</B> ( addr u -- t ) loads a ppm file with the

</UL></P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 SQL Interface</A></H2>

<P>The SQL interface allows to interface with a database using the
structured query language SQL. It now has only an interface to
PostgreSQL, because noone wrote one to other databases.</P>

<P>The database interface has a simple foundation. You can send an SQL
query string and get the result back as a table.
<UL>
<LI><B>database new</B> ( addr u -- ) opens the database specified by
name
<LI><B>exec</B> ( addr u -- ) the query string
<LI><B>fields</B> ( -- n ) the number of fields per result
<LI><B>tuples</B> ( -- n ) the number of tuples (results)
<LI><B>field@</B> ( i -- addr u ) obtains the field name
<LI><B>tuple@</B> ( i j -- addr u ) obtains a tuple entry
<LI><B>clear</B> ( -- ) clears the result buffer
</UL></P>

<P>There are also some output functions to display the result of a
query or to create a table containing the entries
<UL>
<LI><B>.heads</B> ( -- ) displays the field names
<LI><B>.entry</B> ( i -- ) displays an entry line
<LI><B>.entries</B> ( -- ) displays all results including names
<LI><B>entry-box</B> ( -- o ) creates a MINOS object with the query results
</UL></P>

<P>A set of methods facilitates the creations of new tables
<UL>
<LI><B>create(</B> ( addr u -- ) starts creation of a named table
<LI><B>:string</B> ( addr u n -- ) a <TT>varchar</TT> array with n
chars max
<LI><B>:int</B> ( addr u -- ) an integer
<LI><B>:float</B> ( addr u -- ) a floating point number
<LI><B>:date</B> ( addr u -- ) a date
<LI><B>:time</B> ( addr u -- ) a time
<LI><B>inherits</B> ( addr u -- ) inherit mechanism of PostgreSQL,
must be last (there may be multiple inherits statements)
<LI><B>)</B> ( -- ) ends the creation o a table
<LI><B>drop</B> ( addr u -- ) drops a table
</UL></P>

<P>There are also ways to construct a query string
<UL>
<LI><B>select</B> ( addr u -- ) starts a select query, the argument is
the selection; there can be several selections per query
<LI><B>select-distinct</B> ( addr u -- ) starts a select distinct
query
<LI><B>select-as</B> ( addr1 u1 addr2 u2 -- ) argument 1 is the
selection, argument 2 is the name it is assigned to
<LI><B>from</B> ( addr u -- ) specifies the table(s) to select from
<LI><B>where</B> ( addr u -- ) specify where clauses (several combined
with AND)
<LI><B>group</B> ( addr u -- ) grouped by argument
<LI><B>order</B> ( addr u -- ) specifies the ordering argument
<LI><B>order-using</B> ( addr u -- ) specifies order and ordering
operation
</UL></P>
