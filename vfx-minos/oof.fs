\ *T Objekt Oriented Forth
\ =======
\ *P The OOP package documented here here was written by Bernd
\ ** Paysan for his *\i{bigFORTH} system. Since then it has been
\ ** ported to other Forth systems. The package is now known as
\ ** *\i{BerndOOF} for short. The source code is in the file
\ ** *\i{oof.fs}.


\ ***************************************
\ *S What is Object Oriented Programming?
\ ***************************************
\ *P The buzzword of the late 80s and 90s in the IT industry was
\ ** without doubt “object oriented”. No operating system, no
\ ** application, and certainly no programming language, that isn’t
\ ** object oriented. Forth isn’t excluded as publications like Dick
\ ** Pountain’s *\i{Object–Oriented FORTH} show clearly.

\ *P Ewald Rieger had ported Pountain’s OOF to bigFORTH and gave it to
\ ** me on the Forth–Tagung ’91 to look at it. Since this OOF lacked
\ ** several features, I completely rewrote it, to make this
\ ** interesting programming paradigma available for bigFORTH. This
\ ** system is in use since 1992, and has proved to be useful even in
\ ** the rough world of real–time programming. Ewald Rieger uses it to
\ ** control an automatic chromatography system.

\ *P The encapsulation of data and algorithm to form an object has
\ ** shown its usefulness — or more proven essential — especially
\ ** for changing hardware configurations, as they are typical for
\ ** many tasks in practice.

\ *P To give you an impression of what is possible with object
\ ** oriented programming, and how to do it, the following is an
\ ** introduction using a small example. The sources are in the
\ ** file *\i{oofsampl.fth}. I use a small collection of data
\ ** types that are known: integers, lists, arrays, and pointers.
\ ** Object oriented programming hides behind a jargon that,
\ ** after a closer look,has some similatities with concepts
\ ** like modularity and definition of clean interfaces.


\ ====================
\ *N The Class Concept
\ ====================
\ *P The core principle of object oriented programming is to
\ ** encapsulate data and the procedures that operate on the data
\ ** into an object. Ideally the procedures (*\b{methods}) that
\ ** access an object are the only way to operate on the data.
\ ** The interface to the object then consists of the names of
\ ** the methods (*\b{messages}) and the parameters that are sent with
\ ** the message. Since many objects return results, the stack is
\ ** used conventionally for the *\b{message passing} and the
\ ** method is called like a Forth word — with a detour over the
\ ** object, that manages the encapsulation.

\ *P It would be a waste to program each method for each single
\ ** object; especially since many objects have the same or
\ ** similar structure and are only distinguished by the data
\ ** itself. Such similar objects are summed up as a *\b{class}.
\ ** A class is so to speak a template (or a form) for an object;
\ ** after *\b{instantiation} a real object is created from a
\ ** class with space for data, and the methods common for all
\ ** objects of that class.

\ *P Often you need only minor modifications to a class to obtain
\ ** a new one, and therefore you use *\b{inheritance} to create
\ ** a *\b{sublcass} — a derivative. Additional variables and
\ ** modified or new methods are just appended to the class.

\ *P All objects of a class and its subclasses have a common
\ ** message protocol, thus they understand the same messages and
\ ** react similarly. The differences in detail are called
\ ** *\b{polymorphism}. So may each graphical object have the
\ ** method *\b{draw_me}, but one object may draw a circle,
\ ** another a point or rectangle.

\ *P If you emphasise the common protocol to all objects of a
\ ** class hierarchy, you create the protocol separated from the
\ ** implementation of the subclasses and call the class, which
\ ** contains only protocol but no implementation, an
\ ** *\b{abstract data type}. Such a data type is the class
\ ** data presented in the following listing:

\ *E Memory also Forth
\ ** object class data     \ abstract data class
\ **   cell var ref        \ reference counter
\ ** public:
\ **   method !  method @  method .
\ **   method null   method atom?   method #
\ ** how:
\ **   : atom? ( -- flag ) true ;
\ **   : # ( -- n ) 0 ;
\ **   : null ( -- addr ) new ;
\ ** class;

\ *P Here I must add that in *\i{BerndOOF} all classes are eventually
\ ** originated from the same parent class, the class object. Also,
\ ** classes and objects aren’t only used for operating on data,
\ ** but also for creating new subclasses and instantiation of
\ ** objects. Therefore a class is just an object without a data
\ ** area. A class can create new subclasses using the method
\ ** *\fo{class}.

\ *P The description of a class consists of two parts: a
\ ** declaration of variables and methods, and the implementation
\ ** of the methods. All variables, all polymorphic and externally
\ ** accessible methods must be declared; helper methods could
\ ** be declared optionally. In the implementation part,
\ ** undeclared methods are automatically declaired as *\fo{EARLY}
\ ** (private).

\ *P The example creates a cell sized variable called *\fo{ref},
\ ** in the private area of the class that isn’t visible from the
\ ** outside, but can be inherited (thus corresponds to *\b{protected:}
\ ** in C++). *\fo{public:}, thus publically available are the
\ ** six methods *\fo{!}, *\fo{@}, *\fo{.}, *\fo{null},
\ ** *\fo{atom?}, and *\fo{#}, which are used to store, read,
\ ** and display the value, to create a *\b{null} object, the
\ ** query whether the object is atomic or composed, and the number
\ ** of sub objects if the latter is the case.

\ *P The last three methods are already implemented, since they
\ ** are the same for all simple objects. The unimplemented
\ ** methods cannot be executed, more precisely they lead to
\ ** *\fo{abort"}. They must be implemented in real data types,
\ ** like in the following data type *\fo{integer:}.

\ ** data class int
\ **   cell var value
\ ** how:
\ **   : ! value F ! ;
\ **   : @ value F @ ;
\ **   : . @ 0 .r ;
\ **   : init ( data -- ) ! ;
\ **   : dispose
\ **     -1 ref +!  ref F @ 0<=
\ **     IF super dispose THEN ;
\ **   : null ( -- addr ) 0 new ;
\ ** class;

\ *P Here I create a new class in the same manner and allocate a
\ ** (private) variable *\fo{value}. The two methods store and
\ ** fetch (*\fo{!} and *\fo{@}) access *\fo{value}. As an
\ ** interface this is sufficient. The *\fo{F} before the words
\ ** changes the interpretation from the object vocabulary to
\ ** the normal vocabulary, thus the normal Forth kernel words
\ ** *\fo{!} and *\fo{@} are used. The method *\fo{.} is easy
\ ** to understand too. Here the *\fo{@} however is interpreted
\ ** as the access method.

\ *P I must say a few words about the methods *\fo{init} and
\ ** *\fo{dispose}: the *\fo{init} method is called in the
\ ** creation of the object and is used to initialise it.
\ ** Here in the example I initialize *\fo{value} with a number
\ ** on the stack. The *\fo{dispose} method removes an object
\ ** from the dynamic memory management. If you modify this
\ ** method, you must (unlike in C++) explicitely call the
\ ** *\fo{dispose} method of the parent class with
\ ** *\fo{super dispose}. I dispose only if the reference counter
\ ** is zero or negative, meaning that there are no further
\ ** references. Otherwise, the reference counter is just
\ ** decremented.

\ *P The *\fo{null} method now has the meaning as expected: it
\ ** creates an object with the value 0 (dynamically) and leaves
\ ** its address on the stack. The word *\fo{new} is, like
\ ** *\fo{dispose}, a method. Without additional information
\ ** (thus without class or object), the method of the current
\ ** class is used.

\ ==========================
\ *N Binding: Late or Early?
\ ==========================
\ *P Let’s take a step back and look at how methods are called.
\ ** How much must be defined at compile time, and what has to
\ ** be resolved at runtime, and then should not produce an error?

\ *P As long as it is clear which method of which class is executed,
\ ** as with *\fo{super dispose}, it will be resolved at compile
\ ** time and create a direct call to the specified method. This
\ ** is called *\b{early binding}. It’s for sure the fastest
\ ** method, but unfortunately it doesn’t allow for polymorphism.

\ *P Often it is not clear in advance which subclass the object
\ ** belongs to when you want to send a method to it. You have to
\ ** find the address of the method at runtime, then. A search
\ ** in the dictionary is prohibitively inefficient, as well as
\ ** a (possibly even sequential) search over a numerical key
\ ** isn’t what I call run time efficiency.

\ *P In *\i{BerndOOF} therefore, each object contains a pointer to a
\ ** jump table as its first element. The jump table contains the
\ ** addresses of all methods. This doesn’t only guarantee a
\ ** response time independent of the number of methods (after all,
\ ** Forth should still remain a real time language), it is also
\ ** quite fast. Especially, since this approach is so easy to
\ ** code, a simple macro can be directly inserted in the caller’s
\ ** code.

\ *P What’s prevented, or at least made much more difficult, with
\ ** this approach is *\b{multiple inheritance}. Crossing a new
\ ** child class from several parent classes is problematic anyway.
\ ** Methods and variables with the same names must be renamed if
\ ** they are not inherited from the same grandparent class, and
\ ** the offsets of variables in the object change (and so must
\ ** also be determined at runtime). Alternatively, the compiler
\ ** must ensure in advance that the necessary space for the mixed
\ ** class is already reserved in the parent classes. This is a
\ ** space/speed tradeoff that cannot be done with a one-pass
\ ** compiler, and creates difficulties even in complex systems.

\ *P A very important aspect is the real time properties of the
\ ** created code. Thus the run times must be known to the
\ ** programmer. In turn, this only leaves completely deterministic
\ ** approaches for binding. Only then the programmer does not
\ ** lose control of what he writes. C++ does not have this
\ ** property, and therefore is only of limited use for real time
\ ** applications.

\ ================================
\ *N Objects as Instance Variables
\ ================================
\ *P Quite often a straight-forward class hierarchy is good enough.
\ ** Appropriate abstract data types allow us to circumvent real
\ ** multiple inheritance issues. In the case of an emergency, you
\ ** can reach a sort of *\fo{multiple inheritance} by copying
\ ** the sources.

\ *P What is necessary though is to have objects as instance
\ ** variables in other objects, as well as by pointer and direct
\ ** reference. This can be shown using lists as example, since
\ ** they need pointers in their implementation:
\ *E forward nil
\ ** data class lists
\ ** public:
\ **   data ptr first
\ **   data ptr next
\ **   method empty?
\ **   method ?
\ ** how:
\ **   : null nil ;
\ **   : atom? false ;
\ ** class;
\ **
\ ** | lists class nil-class
\ ** how:
\ **   : empty? true ;
\ **   : dispose ;
\ **   : . ." ()" ;
\ ** class;
\ **
\ ** | nil-class : (nil
\ ** (nil self Aconstant nil
\ ** nil (nil bind first
\ ** nil (nil bind next

\ *P Here, we first create an abstract data class for lists; this
\ ** needs as both pointer to first and rest of the list as data.
\ ** Since both may normal data, also *\b{dot pairs} are allowed
\ ** as in Lisp. Would the rest of the list have been a list again,
\ ** the type isn’t necessary; that creates a pointer to the
\ ** object of the current declared class. The phrase
\ ** *\fo{lists ptr next} won’t work, since the class *\fo{lists}
\ ** isn’t completely defined at this point and therefore can’t be
\ ** executed.

\ *P Additionally to these pointers you also need a few methods:
\ ** a list could be empty, so you should be able to ask for that.
\ ** Also, it would be quite useful to display the first element
\ ** (with *\fo{?}).

\ *P A null–list is the empty list, also called *\fo{nil}. Since
\ ** this is a list, it must be declared later, therefore I
\ ** create a forward reference, which is resolved with the later
\ ** definition of *\fo{nil}.

\ *P Empty lists differ from ordinary lists quite significantly.
\ ** They always return true to *\fo{empty?}, there’s only one of
\ ** them, and this one certainly may not deleted. It displays a
\ ** pair of parentheses.

\ *P Now I create an element of the class of empty lists, and the
\ ** address of this element (put on the stack with the method
\ ** *\fo{self}) finally is called *\fo{nil}. Both the first as
\ ** the next element of the empty list is again the empty list.
\ ** That prevents crashes when a program runs over the end of
\ ** the list.

\ *P The method *\fo{bind} allows to bind object references to
\ ** an object pointer. The object pointer *\fo{first} of the
\ ** object *\fo{(nil} behaves, after being bound, exactly like
\ ** the object that it is bound to, thus *\fo{(nil} itself.
\ ** This is more interesting with real lists:

\ *E lists class linked
\ ** how:
\ **   : empty? false ;
\ **   : init ( first next -- )
\ **     dup >o 1 ref +! o> bind next
\ **     dup >o 1 ref +! o> bind first ;
\ **   : ? first . ;
\ **   : @ first @ ;
\ **   : ! first ! ;
\ **   : . self >o ’(
\ **     BEGIN
\ **       emit ? next atom? next self o> >o
\ **       IF ." . " data . o> ." )" EXIT THEN
\ **       bl empty?
\ **     UNTIL
\ **     o> drop ." )" ;
\ **   : # next # 1+ ;
\ **   : dispose
\ **     -1 ref +! ref F @ 0> 0= IF
\ **       first dispose next dispose super dispose
\ **     THEN ;
\ ** class;

\ *P A linked list certainly isn’t empty. On creation, I bind
\ ** the references *\fo{first} and *\fo{next}; appropriate object
\ ** addresses must have been put on the stack. At binding, I
\ ** increment the reference counters of the objects — now
\ ** another pointer points to them. To make them the current
\ ** object, I push them on the object stack, thereby with
\ ** *\fo{ref} their reference counter is addressed, and not the
\ ** one of the list. The object stack isn’t a real stack; only
\ ** the topmost element is put into a register, the rest is on
\ ** the return stack.

\ *P The methods *\fo{@}, *\fo{!} and *\fo{?} refer to the first
\ ** element of the list; they are only passed through. No
\ ** complex pointer arithmetic is necessary, the name of the
\ ** reference is sufficient.

\ *P To print a list, I must walk through the list. Before the
\ ** first element, I open a parenthesis, otherwise the elements
\ ** are separated by blanks. The current first element of the
\ ** list is displayed. If the next element is an atom, it must
\ ** be printed as dot pair; the list ends then. The list also
\ ** ends when the next element is the empty list. Afterwards,
\ ** only the parenthesis has to be closed, and the blank is
\ ** dropped from the stack.

\ *P Surprising is the recursion in *\fo{#}, which competes the
\ ** length of a list. It simply computes the length of the rest
\ ** of the list, increments the result and and finishes. As
\ ** soon as the list terminates with nil or an atom that has
\ ** length=0, the recursion terminates. Here you first see a
\ ** clear advantage of object oriented programming; it makes
\ ** lots of *\fo{IF..ELSE..THEN} for decisions unnecessary and
\ ** therefore eases recursions.

\ *P At deletion of a list, both parts of the list and the node
\ ** itself have to be deleted. Here also no case decision is
\ ** necessary, and the termination question, which is often
\ ** forgotten in recursive programs, isn’t asked here.

\ *P Now we just need element objects for the list. We already
\ ** have numbers, but strings would be nice, too. Here they are:

\ *E int class string
\ ** how:
\ **   : !    ( addr count -- )
\ **          value over 1+ SetHandleSize
\ **          value F @ place ;
\ **   : @    ( -- addr count ) value F @ count ;
\ **   : .    @ type ;
\ **   : init ( addr count -- )
\ **     dup 1+ value Handle! ! ;
\ **   : null S" " new ;
\ **   : dispose
\ **           ref F @ 1- 0> 0=
\ **           IF value HandleOff THEN
\ **           super dispose ;
\ ** class;

\ *P We derive the class string from *\fo{int}. I use its
\ ** instance variable value as handle, as pointer to a movable
\ ** memory area. There, the string is stored as counted string.
\ ** When storing a new string, the size of the memory block must
\ ** be adusted; at the first time, it must be allocated, and
\ ** freed at deletion. All the rest is self-explaining, I hope.

\ *P Very useful is the pointer class. You can directly create
\ ** pointer variables, but you can’t insert them into e.g. a
\ ** list.

\ *E data class pointer
\ ** public:
\ **   data ptr container
\ **   method ptr!
\ ** how:
\ **   : !    container ! ;
\ **   : @    container @ ;
\ **   : .    container . ;
\ **   : #    container # ;
\ **   : init ( data -- ) dup >o 1 ref +! o> bind container ;
\ **   : ptr! ( data -- ) container dispose init ;
\ **   : dispose
\ **     -1 ref +! ref F @ 0> 0=
\ **     IF container dispose super dispose THEN ;
\ **   : null nil new ;
\ ** class;

\ *P Analoguous to the list I create a pointer instance variable
\ ** *\fo{(pointer)}; then there’s the method *\fo{ptr!}, which
\ ** is used to assign a new object. The methods *\fo{@}, *\fo{!},
\ ** *\fo{.} and *\fo{#} are fed through to the container. The
\ ** *\fo{init} method binds a passed object to the pointer. The
\ ** method *\fo{ptr!} first releases the previous object, and
\ ** afterwards stores the new object. I certainly care about
\ ** reference counting here.

\ *P Deletion of a pointer object also means that one pointer
\ ** less points to the object (and it eventually has to be
\ ** deleted); afterwards, the pointer is deleted.

\ *P Analoguous to a pointer you can create a whole array of
\ ** pointers:
\ *E data class array
\ ** public:
\ **   data [] container
\ **   cell var range
\ ** how:
\ **   : !         ( <value> n -- ) container ! ;
\ **   : @         ( n -- <value> ) container @ ;
\ **   : .         ’[ # 0
\ **               ?DO emit I container . ’, LOOP
\ **               drop ." ]" ;
\ **   : init      ( data n -- ) range F ! bind container ;
\ **   : dispose   -1 ref +! ref F @ 0> 0=
\ **               IF  # 0
\ **                   ?DO I container dispose LOOP
\ **                   super dispose
\ **               THEN ;
\ **   : null      ( -- addr ) nil 0 new ;
\ **   : #         ( -- n ) range F @ ;
\ **   : atom?     ( -- flag ) false ;
\ ** class;

\ *P Similarly to the method *\fo{new} you create a new array of
\ ** objects with *\fo{new[]} which contains elements of this
\ ** class. The array really is an array of pointers, you can
\ ** assign other objects at any position of the array with
\ ** *\fo{bind[]}. The array index for accessing an array
\ ** variable is expected on the stack.


\ =================================
\ *N Tools and Application Examples
\ =================================
\ *P The list packet still isn’t very easy to use. I’ve written a
\ ** few small tools that eases the use — but certainly won’t
\ ** make up a complete Lisp or something like that out of it:

\ *E : cons         linked new ;
\ ** : list         nil cons ;
\ ** : car          >o lists first self o> ;
\ ** : cdr          >o lists next self o> ;
\ ** : print        >o data . o> ;
\ ** : ddrop        >o data dispose o> ;
\ ** : make-string  string new ;
\ ** : $"           state @ IF
\ **                  compile S" compile make-string exit
\ **                THEN
\ **                ’" parse make-string ; immediate

\ *P The words *\fo{cons} and *\fo{list} help to create a list.
\ ** *\fo{Cons} concatenates two objects on the stack to a
\ ** list (TOS as next, thus should be a list; NOS as first
\ ** element of the list). *\fo{List} takes an object and
\ ** together with *\fo{nil} creates a list out of it.

\ *P *\fo{Car} and *\fo{cdr} should be known from Lisp; they
\ ** return first with respect to the rest of the list.

\ *P *\fo{Print} calls the output method of an object.

\ *P *\fo{Ddrop} finally removes and deletes an object.

\ *P *\fo{Make-string} is the string constructor, analogous
\ ** to *\fo{list}.

\ *P *\fo{$"} constructs a string constant.

\ *P As example how to create a list with these tools:
\ *E $" Dies" $" ist" $" ein" list cons $" Test" list cons cons ok
\ ** dup print (Dies (ist ein) Test) ok
\ ** pointer : test ok
\ ** test . (Dies (ist ein) Test) ok
\ ** test # . 3 ok


\ ************************************
\ *S The Complete BerndOOF Description
\ ************************************
\ *P The interface to object oriented programming in *\i{BerndOOF}
\ ** divides into three parts:
\ *(
\ *B Tools to manage objects, which are themselves not object
\ ** related, and the classes from which all other classes and
\ ** objects are derived,
\ *B Tools to create instance variables and methods,
\ *B methods of the root class, to create new classes, instances,
\ ** handling of object pointers and similar things.
\ *)

\ *P Only the words of the first item above are directly
\ ** accessible from the *\fo{FORTH} vocabulary. The words of
\ ** the second item are only available during declaration of a
\ ** class, and the words of the third item are not words in the
\ ** traditional Forth sense, but are methods of objects.

\ *P *\i{BerndOOF} uses a coherent way to manage classes: classes are
\ ** objects, although with class global instance variables, that
\ ** are just used to create and manage new classes and objects.
\ ** Classes are also used to send messages to objects whose
\ ** address is stored in an object pointer, and that need
\ ** explicit context (because it’s not the current defined
\ ** object), thus are also used as a sort of type casting.
